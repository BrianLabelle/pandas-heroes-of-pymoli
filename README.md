### Hard

* My solution will includes everything from the moderate challenge.

* My solution will also be able to return the stock with the "Greatest % increase", "Greatest % Decrease" and "Greatest total volume".


### CHALLENGE

* I made appropriate adjustments to your script that will allow it to run on every worksheet, i.e., every year, just by running it once.

* This can be applied to any of the difficulties. ( I removed the stock ticker with 0 values in it )

### Other Considerations

* My script acts the same on each sheet. 


## Submission

* Submitted to GitHub:

  * Microsoft Word Document with 3 screenshots for each year of the Multi-Stock-Year Data.
  * VBA Script as separate files and the exported module file in BAS just incase.
